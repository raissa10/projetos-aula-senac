# swap_poker
Poker game made in native JS ES6, HTML5 and CSS3

This is a responsive one page app written in completely native HTML, CSS (Flexbox) and Javascript.  
The JS file includes object-oriented code to create playing card and deck objects and data bind them to DOM elements.
This project demonstrates:
- Two way data binding in JS and HTML/CSS
- Complex logic to calculate poker scores
- OOP in JS
- Responsive Web Design

Its you against a shuffled deck - What you discard is just as important as what you keep!
